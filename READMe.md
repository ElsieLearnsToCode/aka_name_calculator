Akan Name Calculator
#### {Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}
This is an online program that takes a user's birthday and determines the day of the week on which they were born, then outputs their Akan Name based on their gender. Ghanian culture gave rise to Akan names. In Ghana, children's first names are sometimes given as a 'day name,' which corresponds to the day of the week they were born.
